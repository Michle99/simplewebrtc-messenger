# WebRTC Video Chat App

# Introduction
This is a video chat app built with SimpleWebRTC. SimpleWebRTC is a JavaScript library that simplifies WebRTC peer-to-peer data, video, and audio calls. SimpleWebRTC acts as a wrapper around the browser’s WebRTC implementation. 
As you might already know, browser vendors don’t exactly agree on a single way of implementing different features, which means that for every browser there’s a different implementation for WebRTC. As the developer, you’d have to write different code for every browser you plan to support. SimpleWebRT acts as the wrapper for that code. The API that it exposes is easy to use and understand, which makes it a really great candidate for implementing cross-browser WebRTC.

# Dependencies
